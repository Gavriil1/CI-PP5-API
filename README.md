## Testing

The Manual test was carried out on the app:


### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, notes,and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Note | Create, update & delete | A post can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A like can be created or deleted (like / unlike post) | Works as expected

In addition, notes,  likes  can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
